# Machine learning
Machine learning is technology that train pattern and rule in data to computer, then computer can solve problems based on mathmatical models in trained data.
There is subconcept of machine learning, which is deep learning.
deep learning is similar to machine learning, but deep learning normally use neural netwrok structure.

* algorithms : the method or order to solve the problem.
* machine learning : let machine learn about pattern and make the automatic algorithms.
* big data : so huge data that is hard to collect, save and analyze in existing database.
Machine learning has basic structure that y = f(x). Machine learning is procedure of find that y with use data(x). It will present f(), which we want.

We can solve two types of problems.
One is classification.
In classification, it's really hard to classify real data for human, however if we use machine learning we can solve that problem just time and data for training.
There is no reason for wrestle with the calculator.

The other one is regression.
In regression, if we give data(x) then machine use model and predict answer data(y).
regression has simple structure : y = ax + b, yeah it's really simple, however find the answer is tough one, because we must find total model with a & b = two variants only data(x) and y.

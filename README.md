## 1.Introduce
    Hello, I'm Nelchois. 
    I'm a beginner about how to manage text data. 
    This page is a note for my daily study. 
    So I will update this page as much as I can.
    I will write down this page in English. 
    However, I'm not so good at English, so please understand issues in grammar or word.  
    Thank you for reading.

### 2.Current situation
    Now is February, recently I didn't commit my git_hub account that there some reason. After last November, I changed my problem solving web site from [BOJ](https://www.acmicpc.net) to [PRO](https://programmers.co.kr/). There is function that can link my PRO account to git_hub. So, I linked my account. I thought they sent my code to git_hub automaticaly, but they didn't. That's why my commit is stopped. Now, I check the issuse and start commit again.

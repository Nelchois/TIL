## 1.Introduce
    Hello, I'm Nelchois. 
    I'm a beginner about how to manage text data. 
    This page is a note for my daily study. 
    So I will update this page as much as I can.
    I will write down this page in English. 
    However, I'm not so good at English, so please understand issues in grammar or word.  
    Thank you for reading.

## Queue
Queue is contrast as Stack. In Queue data access severed as FIFO(First in First out).
```inqueue()``` means put the data in queue.
```dequeue()``` means delete the data in queue. It's same as pop() in Stack.

In Queue, we should know about first_data and last_data. So we call first_data = front_index and last_data = append.

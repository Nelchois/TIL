Hello, this is Song.
After finished our course, I tried to learn about Data_structures, because my major is management, so I have to learn essential subjects in computing science.

I take Data_Structure in Python by Chan_Su Shin from HANKUK UNIVERSITY OF FOREIGN STUDIES, in [youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PIidtIBCjEg&list=PLsMufJgu5933ZkBCHS7bQTx0bncjwi4PK).

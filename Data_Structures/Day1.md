## Basic concept of words
Algorithm : The result of data that finite calculated by memory which read, write, search, delete and insert. 

Examples of data_structures : variable, array, list ... ect

## Time complexity
We assume virtual environment which virtual machine, pesudo language, pseudo code. To assume virtual environment, we don't care about difference of performance among machines.

### Virtual machine
Our machine has changed Turing machine to Von Neumanm archtectures.
In that archtectures consist by RAM(Random Access Machine) = CPU + Memory + basic calculation. 
Basic calculation is calculation carried out in 1 unit time, which means assignment, substitution, college, copy, arithmetic(except likes remainder operation), compare operation, logical operation, bit operation.

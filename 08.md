This is Nelchois, now days I use Jupyter notebook. Because I learned about how can I use numpy and pandas. It's easy to check line to line moreover there is immediate feedback if a code line is running.
## Numpy
Numpy is module that make us easy to using matrix like this.
```
import numpy as np
t_arr=np.array([1,4,5,8],float) #We can give data type
t_arr
``` 
Also they give to us that data's information.
```t_3=[[[1,2,5,8],[4,5,6,7],[6,7,8,9]],[[1,2,5,8],[4,5,6,7],[6,7,8,9]],[[1,2,5,8],[4,5,6,7],[6,7,8,9]]]
np.array(t_3).shape
```
Then they return us (3,3,4) which means t_3 have axis = 2. 
Don't confuse axis is started at 0 so 2 means it's a 3D matrix.

Axis is most important thing in Numpy. It's a standard of matrix calculation in Numpy. 
Here's some example codes
``` 
import numpy as np
t_a=np.arange(1,11)
print(t_a.sum())
t_a2=np.arange(1,13).reshape(3,4)
print(t_a2)
t_a2.sum(axis=0) 
```
The final code(t_a2.sum(axis=0) is return the sum of line that array([15,18,21,24]). However, if you give 1 in axis then it will return the sum of row in that array([10,26,42]). So axis=0 means proximate dimension that similar to index.

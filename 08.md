This is Nelchois, now days I use Jupyter notebook. Because I learned about how can I use numpy and pandas. It's easy to check line to line moreover there is immediate feedback if a code line is running.
## Numpy
Numpy is module that make us easy to using matrix like this.
```
import numpy as np
t_arr=np.array([1,4,5,8],float) #We can give data type
t_arr
``` 
Also they give to us that data's information.
```t_3=[[[1,2,5,8],[4,5,6,7],[6,7,8,9]],[[1,2,5,8],[4,5,6,7],[6,7,8,9]],[[1,2,5,8],[4,5,6,7],[6,7,8,9]]]
np.array(t_3).shape
```
Then they return us (3,3,4) which means t_3 have axis = 2. 
Don't confuse axis is started at 0 so 2 means it's a 3D matrix.

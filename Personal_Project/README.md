Hello, this is Nelchois.
This is my personal project that using crawler and deep learning with morphological analysis.

First, Using crawler to get review data in steam. I chodse 'Eternal Return', because this game has a lot of reviews which is complex recommendation.   

Second, Preprocess the review data. Basically, reviews are contain many factors like slang, vilification, emoticon or punctuation marks. These things disturb for analyzing. So, we need preprocessing.
